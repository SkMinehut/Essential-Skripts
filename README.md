# Skript Dump
List of essential skripts on minehut

# How to use:
- Skripts that are put in folders are supposed to be with eachother. These could be remakes of plugins, servers, etc. Skripts that don't require multiple files or aren't specific remakes of plugins have been put outside of folders.

These skripts are made for use on minehut. Most of them have been created by me, so if you need help, contact me on discord (@nicholxs#3557).

Also, please don't take credit and claim that these skripts are your own, I have made them public to help out players. I am also happy for other people to contribute to them, make a github account and then create issues (for suggestions) and pull requests to suggest change in code.
