List of essential skripts on minehut

These skripts are made for use on minehut. Most of them have been created by me, so if you need help, contact me on discord (@nicholxs#3557).

Also, please don't take credit and claim that these skripts are your own, I have made them public to help out players. I am also happy for other people to contribute to them, make a github account and then create issues (for suggestions) and pull requests to suggest change in code.
